# Codelists

Codelists provide codes and titles which ensure that data from different publishers can be made **comparabale** and **interoperable**.

There are two approaches to the use of codelists within the Specification: **open** and **closed** codelists.

* Open codelists provide a number of **suggested** values that will find matched usage across a wide range of publishers, but are ultimately not exhaustible. These codelists can therefore be extended by a publisher (or group of publishers) as needed by providing additional codes and titles.
* Closed codelists **limit** usage to those codes and titles in the pre-defined list. Though a closed codelist can be changed in future versions to include more codes, publishers can use only those values presented in the current version.
