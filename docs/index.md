.. attention::
    **This documentation site is a work in progress.**

    The Social Investment Data Lab Specification is being developed as a draft data specification to describe social investment. For more information contact jack.lord@opendataservices.coop or bob.harper@opendataservices.coop

For open data to be really useful it has to follow a common data model – a specification – so that data from many publishers can be compared.

We are developing the Social Investment Data Lab Specification for this purpose. This specification ensure that when all your data is made available online, it can be easily transferrable between different applications.

This is how we make sure that when you use the data, the results can be compared.

The Social Investment Data Lab Specification is:

* **Open data driven**: providing a common way to share transparent and interoperable information on social investment.
* **Easy to use**: offering a simple spreadsheet format for publishing and consuming data, backed up by a structured data model, and developer-friendly JSON serialisation.
* **Comprehensive**: delivering a full view of social investment. Describing the whole investment process and supporting the in-depth analysis of deals, grants, loans and beneficiaries in the social investment market.
