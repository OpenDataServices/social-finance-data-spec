For open data to be really useful it has to follow a common data model – a specification – so that data from many publishers can be compared.

We are developing the Social Economy Data Lab Specification for this purpose. The Specification ensures that when your data is made available online, it can be easily transferable between different applications.

This is how we make sure that when you use the data, the results can be compared.

See the [Getting Started](getting_started/index) page for more information.

<!--
Social Economy Data Lab Specification is:

* **Open data driven**: providing a common way to share transparent and interoperable information on social investment.
* **Easy to use**: offering a simple spreadsheet format for publishing and consuming data, backed up by a structured data model, and developer-friendly JSON serialisation.
* **Comprehensive**: delivering a full view of social investment. Describing the whole investment process and supporting the in-depth analysis of deals, grants, loans and beneficiaries in the social investment market.
